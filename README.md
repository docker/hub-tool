The Docker Hub Tool is a CLI tool for interacting with the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
It makes it easy to get information about your images from the terminal and to
perform Hub maintenance tasks.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your
  system
- [A Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com)

### Install

- Download the latest release for your platform from
  [here](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/releases)
- Extract the package and place the `hub-tool` binary somewhere in your `PATH`

OR

- Install from sources: `GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/docker/hub-tool`

### Login to Docker Hub

Login to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) using your username and
password:

```console

## Contributing

Docker wants to work with the community to make a tool that is useful and to
ensure that its UX is good. Remember that this is an experiment with the goal of
incorporating the learnings into the Docker CLI so it has some rough edges and
it's not meant to be a final product.

To get started wtih contributing, run `make help`. The commands that standout as
helpful for new contributors are 

```
make lint      => make sure all files are formatted with 'go fmt'
make test-unit => run unit tests
make e2e       => run end-to-end tests
make           => build it all for the local OS
```

For rapid iteration on running the project, use `go run main.go <args>`.
Additional logging can be enabled by using the `--debug` or `--trace` flags.


### Feedback

Please leave your feedback in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/issues)!
We'd love to know how you're using this tool and what features you'd like to see
us add.

### Code

At this stage of the project, we're mostly looking for feedback. We will accept
pull requests but these should be limited to minor improvements and fixes.
Anything larger should first be discussed as an issue.
If you spot a bug or see a typo, please feel free to fix it by putting up a
[pull request](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/pulls)!

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- `make`

### Compiling

To build for your current platform, simply run `make` and the tool will be
output into the `./bin` directory:

```console
$ make
docker build --build-arg GO_VERSION=1.15.3 --build-arg ALPINE_VERSION=3.12.0 --build-arg GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION=v1.31.0-alpine --build-arg TAG_NAME= --build-arg GOTESTSUM_VERSION=0.5.2 --build-arg BINARY_NAME=hub-tool --build-arg BINARY=hub-tool . \
                --output type=local,dest=./bin \
                --platform local \
                --target hub
